#Functionality

With this app you can add a burger into the input field, and once you hit submit it will appear on the "menu" of burgers available for consumption. You can then click the "devour" button, and it will be listed under the devoured burgers.


#Issues

I'm still having issues with Heroku, and I'm going to seek out help from a TA, but my tutor helped me out a lot with correcting the routes and and the proper use of handlebars.

It's fully functional on my local host, but I'm guessing because I don't have an index.html as my landing page, my github live link is not working.
